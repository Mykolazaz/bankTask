*Data from subtask1.rmd (Data Manipulation Task) and subtask2.rmd (Data Visualization Task) must be loaded into the environment.*

Let's begin by looking at how many clients that decided to subscribe we have in our data set.

```{r}
summary(bank_full$subscribed)
```

```{r}
model1 <- glm(subscribed ~ age + job + marital + education + in_default + balance + housing_loan +
               personal_loan + contact_type + day + month + duration + campaign + pdays +
               previous, data = bank_full, family = binomial)
summary(model1)
```
