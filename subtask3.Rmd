*Data from subtask1.rmd (Data Manipulation Task) and subtask2.rmd (Data Visualization Task) must be loaded into the environment.*

Let's begin by looking at how many clients that decided to subscribe we have in our data set.

```{r}
summary(bank_full$subscribed)
```

We can now separate our original data set into two: training and testing.

```{r}
set.seed(167)
sample_size <- round(0.8 * nrow(bank_full))

train_indices <- sample(seq_len(nrow(bank_full)), size = sample_size)

train_data <- bank_full[train_indices, ]
test_data  <- bank_full[-train_indices, ]
```

We'll avoid filling missing variable values for now.

```{r}
model1 <- glm(subscribed ~ age + job + marital + education + in_default + balance + housing_loan +
               personal_loan + contact_type + day + month + duration + campaign + pdays +
               previous, data = test_data, family = binomial)
summary(model1)
```
